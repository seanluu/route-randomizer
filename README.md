# üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Route Randomizer

Route Randomizer is a mobile app that generates random walking routes based on distance, weather, and your preferences. Tired of walking the same paths every day? This app uses Google Maps to create new routes around your location that you might not have explored before. It keeps track of your walking history and stats, and adapts to current weather conditions.
