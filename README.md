# üö∂‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Route Randomizer

Route Randomizer is a mobile app that generates random walking routes based on distance, weather, and your preferences, and finds new routes so they don't get repetitive in your daily routine, and also keeps track of your walking history and stats, and adapts to current weather conditions.
